\chapter{Product Description}
\section{Product Overview}
FleetEye seeks to reduce road accidents through intelligent monitoring of vehicle drivers.

The product is a single device that mounts onto a dashboard of a vehicle. The basic working version of the product will have a camera pointing in the direction of the driver that focuses on the drivers eyes. The device will monitor a drivers eyes and detect if they close. When the eyes close for a period of time longer than blinking, then the device assumes that the driver is sleeping and takes corrective measures to wake the driver up.

What is being sold is not a single device, but rather a range of products. This product range will all have the same goal(keeping a driver awake) but with different features depending on the model bought. The first prototype produced will be the most basic device but once production is up and running more complex products can be developed and sold.

\section{Technical description of FleetEye}

The basic product consists of four main hardware components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Driver Facing Camera - The camera facing the driver provides live video of the driver so that algorithms can be performed on the drivers face in real time. Furthemore the camera is able to see images in low light conditions.
  \item Speaker - The speaker is used to wake the driver up. The speaker will play randomly generated noises. This prevents the driver from getting used to the sounds and thus will be more likely to wake him up\cite{Habituation}.
  \item Micro-controller - Once the camera has filmed the video, the Micro-controller needs to process this video, the video is processed in real time and as such a micro-controller powerful enough to perform real time video processing will be used. The micro-controller performs the eye tracking and detection using OpenCV algorithms - these are free and open source video and image processing software algorithms. The micro-controller will also manage the speaker and ensure it plays a sounds when the driver is detected to be asleep \cite{OpenCV}.
  \item Power Supply - In order to keep the device operating the device needs a source of power. The device can be either plugged into the 12V plug all cars have or it can be directly connected to the car power source for permanent mounts. The power is transformed to the correct voltage at the power supply unit. This unit will also provide surge protection.
  
The product has various modes of operation as seen in \cref{fig:DeviceFlowChart}. The default mode is the passive scanning mode where the device detects the drivers face and monitors eye movement. However once the eye is detected as closed the product  enters a minor emergency state where it assumes the driver has just dosed off. The device emits a brief sound to wake the driver up. If this does not work it assumes the drive is in a deeper state of sleep and proceeds to take more drastic action. The action taken depends on the time the driver remains unresponsive and functions of the installed product.

\section{Competitor product analysis}
There are currently two primary international competitors producing a similar product. Seeing Machines in Australia have developed a technology that tracks driver eyelid movement through computer vision algorithms. They monitor the frequency and duration of blinking, as well as eyelid velocity. If the driver’s head begins to drop, an audio alarm is triggered and the seat vibrates. If they fall asleep again, a dispatcher is alerted and may make radio contact with the driver to check if they need a break. Seeing Machines has specifically worked with drivers that operate Caterpillar mining equipment.

The second competitor company is Exeros, based in the United Kingdom. Their product is targeted at businesses that operate a fleet of vehicles. When the driver begins to fall asleep, audio tones are sounded to attempt to wake them up. The devices they produce are able to be connected to an external GPS so that when an alarm is triggered, an outside individual can be notified of the occurrence and the location.

% --Extra sources/info--
% Toyota has implemented a driver alertness sensor as early as 2008 in their upmarket Toyota Crown cars. This camera detects the upper and lower eyelids, calculating how open they are. The car has built-in proximity sensors outside the car to measure what’s happening and to apply the brakes or prepare the airbags depending on the probability of a collision.

% HARMAN technology has developed a pupil-based driver monitoring system which interprets the level of the driver’s cognitive load and mental multitasking ability, adapting the car’s interface and connected devices accordingly. This drowsiness monitoring can cause the car to automatically turn the driver’s mobile device into do-not-disturb mode or adjusting ADAS system intervention thresholds to minimize physical and mental distraction to the driver.

\section{Advantages of FleetEye over competitor products} 
FleetEye’s unique features allow it to perform several of the tasks currently performed by competing products.

\section{Product positioning}
The product will be versatile enough to cater for the needs of a number of industries. The following sectors are considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Heavy duty freight truck drivers
\item Bus drivers
\item Construction equipment operators (cranes, diggers, etc.)
\item Taxi drivers
\item Private use
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem background}
Over 5500 people lost their lives on South Africa’s roads between 2014 and 2015. This harrowing statistic stirred in us a desire to engineer a product capable of making our roads a safer place for all. 
%http://ewn.co.za/2015/09/11/RTMC-report-reveals-shocking-SA-road-death-stats
South Africa’s railway system is currently unable to support the needs of the growing economy. With 88\% of all freight being moved on the roads, many truck drivers are exposed daily to the risks of falling asleep at the wheel.

\section{Market research}
No local competitors currently exist in the market. We expect to capture a significant portion of the market due to the product’s relative novelty and necessity.
